There are resources available to you. If you are considering adoption and live in Ohio, you will want to find an Ohio adoption agency that you can trust.",
        "The next thing to know about adoption is that it is not “giving up.” While the saying “give baby up for adoption” is still used in everyday conversation, the adoption community no longer uses this phrase because it is dated and completely incorrect. Adoption is a brave, thoughtful, and loving decision. It means putting the needs of your child before your own.",
        "Placing a baby for adoption is a positive choice that takes strength and devotion from a birth mother. You are already considering what is best for your child. You can give your child a wonderful life, full of love and opportunity, with adoption."

        "An adoption agency is an organization, licensed by the state(s) they work in, that places children in permanent homes with adoptive families. Ohio adoption agencies offer a range of services to expectant/birth parents considering adoption. Full-service organizations, such as Adoptions With Love, offer expectant/birth parents legal and counseling services, adoption planning support, financial assistance related to pregnancy and birth, the ability to choose an already vetted family that is ready to adopt a baby, and more. These services are all free to expectant/birth parents who choose adoption.",
        "While these services are important, it is important to look for an adoption agency that can offer compassionate care throughout the adoption journey. Adoptions With Love understands the emotional challenges that accompany an unplanned pregnancy and adoption journey. We have been facilitating private adoptions in Ohio since 1986 and can help guide you through this process every step of the way."

        "Full-Service, Private Adoption Agencies in Ohio",
        "Private adoption agencies match expectant/birth mothers with approved adoptive families within the United States. This is the most common type of agency young people choose when facing unplanned pregnancy. This type of organization will provide professional, reputable, and comprehensive adoption services, prioritizing the mother’s and child’s needs. Private adoption agencies in Ohio include large, national agencies as well as smaller organizations. Smaller agencies may work locally and nationally, but typically provide more personalized care. Whichever type of agency you choose, your adoption should be a smooth process, full of counseling, education, and compassionate care.",
        "Choosing to work with a private, full-service adoption agency in Ohio means having more control of the adoption plan. You may choose the adoptive family and whether you want to continue communication with them after placing your baby for adoption. You are in charge of this pregnancy and this adoption plan. You can determine the type of adoption plan you have, and the form and frequency of ongoing communication.",
        "Contact a Full Service, Private Ohio Adoption Agency",
        "Foster Care Agencies in Ohio",
        "Foster care is a state-run system. It is not a path taken by expectant/birth mothers who are voluntarily choosing adoption for their child. If you know that your home life is not suitable for a child, then you can avoid foster care by choosing a private adoption in Ohio.",
        "Adoption Facilitators in Ohio",
        "An adoption facilitator is a professional that makes an initial contact between birth parent(s) and adoptive family. Most adoption facilitators require a fee that will only cover the cost of the introduction of families (and nothing else). The facilitators’ only role is making an initial connection between birth and adoptive families. They do not provide ongoing services or support. Using a full-service adoption agency will provide expectant/birth mothers complete care and ensure a safe, legal adoption from start to finish."

This type of agency should offer comprehensive services – at no cost to you – and respect your decisions. The best adoption agencies in Ohio will listen to your concerns, understand your needs, and guide you through the adoption process with zero judgment, pressure, or criticism. You will want to find an adoption agency that can support you and keep you informed. At Adoptions With Love, for example, our Ohio adoption attorney team will make sure you understand your rights. They will answer any questions you have about Ohio adoption laws.",
        "One of the biggest benefits of working with a reputable Ohio adoption agency is the safety and security you will feel during the adoption process. Every step of the process is covered by your adoption professional. From the early phases of the Home Study – a thorough background check and interview process for prospective adoptive parents – to the guidance of your adoption plan, and continued counseling services after birth, you can rest assured that your adoption will be handled fully and properly."

        "Adoption is a choice that comes with many other choices. As you plan this adoption in Ohio, you will want to consider the type of adoption plan you have. You can choose from the following:",
        "Open adoption is the most common type of adoption today. Open adoption is not co-parenting. While open adoption in Ohio can look different for every family, it means there is communication between birth and adoptive families. You, the expectant/birth parent, can choose the adoptive family for your baby. You can also determine the form and frequency of ongoing communication. Whether you want to stay connected with text messages once a month, email a few times a year, or have calls or visits, your wishes will be respected. Your adoption specialist can help you determine the best arrangement for the open adoption plan.",
        "A semi-open adoption is not as open as an open adoption, but with this type of plan, you can still have some ongoing contact. Your adoption professional can work as a liaison and ensure you stay anonymous with any contact, if that makes you feel comfortable. You can also choose your child’s adoptive family and speak with – or meet – them in person before the birth if you wish. Sometimes, a semi-open adoption looks like only choosing the adoptive family. You can decide what level of openness is right for you. Your adoption specialist can also help you with this decision.",
        "A closed adoption is exactly as it sounds. There is no communication or information shared between birth and adoptive parents. This is not as common as semi-open or open adoption today, but it is still a choice that you have. There is no right or wrong choice, either. Some birth mothers feel they need a fresh start, and a clean break is the best way to achieve that. Whatever decision you make, a supportive Ohio adoption agency like Adoptions With Love will support you. Adoptions With Love keeps photos and letters on file, should a birth mother choose closed adoption but change her mind later."
