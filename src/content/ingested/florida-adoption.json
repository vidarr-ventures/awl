For example, you may find there are private adoption agencies and foster care adoption agencies. There are also non-profit and for-profit adoption agencies. There are large, national agencies that work with thousands of birth mothers at once, across the nation. There are also small, personalized Florida Adoption Entities that work with qualified agency professionals selected because of their experience and compassion, working closely with each birth mother to create an adoption plan. Unlike a Florida adoption agency, a Florida attorney is able to work with agency professionals to create a team of knowledgeable adoption professionals experienced to meet each mother’s individual needs."

        "The decision to work with a reputable adoption professional in Florida offers many benefits:",
        "The main benefit of working with an adoption agency, and with an adoption attorney in Florida, is that it will ensure your adoption plan is legal and safe. You will work closely with the adoption agency professionals and a Florida adoption entity to choose a family that has been formally approved to adopt a baby. You will work with Florida adoption attorneys to ensure your adoption meets all the legal requirements, and your baby is officially placed with their adoptive family. If you do not use a reputable adoption entity in Florida, you run the risk of choosing an unverified family, meeting in an unsafe environment, and/or completing an illegal adoption.",
        "As noted above, working with adoption agency professionals and a reputable adoption entity ensures your adoption will be safe. This also means your child will be placed with a safe and stable family, who has been approved to adopt. All adoptive families approved through an adoption agency complete a thorough background check and home study process. This involves at-home visits to ensure their home is safe and stable, and several interviews to ensure they are ready to raise and love a child. We also conduct FBI background checks and local criminal checks, gather references, and assess financial and health information, all to ensure that a baby will be supported fully in their new home.",
        "Working with an adoption agency does not mean you need to give up control of the process. The right adoption agency will understand that, as an expectant/birth mother, you know what is best for your baby. Therefore, you will have the opportunity to make choices on behalf of your child. For example, if you would like, you can choose an adoptive family for your baby. Your adoption agency will send you profiles and photo albums of hopeful families that are ready to raise and love a child. You can learn about their background, love story, values, and personal interests. This can help paint a picture of how your child’s life and future will look, and you can even speak with (or meet) the family in advance if you would like.",
        "Consider working with an adoption agency that offers open adoption services in Florida. This will give you the ability to make more choices throughout the adoption process. Whether you want an open, semi-open, or closed adoption, you can design an adoption plan with which you feel comfortable. Every adoption plan is unique. For you, it may involve staying in touch with the adoptive family via emails, online photo exchange, or text messaging. You may decide you would like to receive an email update and photos once a year. The best adoption plan will cater to your needs, and you will have a counselor working with you to help make it official. While the adoption plan is a formal agreement, you are not bound to this one plan forever. If you decide to have a closed adoption, you may be able to open it later. This flexibility gives many birth parents a sense of security, knowing that adoption does not always mean “goodbye” forever.",
        "The right adoption professional will cover the costs related to your adoption, from counseling to legal services. Adoption is a complicated and emotional journey, and you deserve support at every step of the way. Through our adoption services, you will receive free counseling prior to the adoption, to ensure you are comfortable with this decision, and education from our Florida adoption counselors. You will also receive free legal services leading up to the adoption, and for the placement of your baby, through a caring and expert Florida adoption lawyer. After birth, the support does not disappear. Our counseling services continue after the adoption, as you cope with post-pregnancy and beyond.",

Choose an adoption professional that is well-versed in Florida’s adoption laws, and that has experience with prior adoptions in Florida. You should also consider an adoption agency with professionals who can answer any questions you have along the way.",
        "Below are common questions we receive from expectant/birth mothers in Florida.",
        "Who must consent to an adoption in Florida?",
        "According to the State of Florida, a birth mother or any person who is lawfully entitled to the custody of the child may provide written consent to an adoption, to terminate parental rights. A birth father’s consent is only required if he timely files an affidavit of paternity with Florida’s Putative Father Registry; a court has established paternity; the child was conceived or born during his marriage to the birth mother; or he has acknowledged paternity in writing, if unmarried.",
        "When can you consent to adoption in Florida?",
        "For a birth father, consent to adoption may be given at any time before or after the child is born. For a birth mother, consent may not be given until at least 48 hours after the child’s birth or on the day she is discharged from the hospital – whichever comes first. This gives the birth mother time to make sure she is confident with her decision. Once the adoption consent forms are signed, they are irrevocable. Your adoption attorney will help you understand these (and other) laws specific to Florida adoptions.",
        "How can you know you are choosing the right family for your baby?",
        "Many expectant/birth mothers say they felt an instant connection with an adoptive family profile. Some expectant/birth mothers take more time with the decision and weigh the values, backgrounds, and interests of various adoptive families. Only you will know which family is right for your baby. However, you can rest assured that no matter which family you choose, you will be choosing a loving, stable family. All adoptive families must undergo a Home Study prior to adopting. This months-long process involves several interviews and home visits, background checks, a physical assessment of the safety of the home, references, and documents ensuring the physical, mental, emotional, and financial health of the family. By working with families approved by Adoptions With Love, we know that our adoptive parents also attend comprehensive parent training courses before the adoption.",
        "What happens after placing your baby for adoption in Florida?",
        "Once the adoption is complete, birth parents are encouraged to continue counseling services. They are also encouraged to keep in touch, both with the adoption specialists and the adoptive family. Adoption is a lifelong journey, and Amy Hickman and the professionals at Adoptions With Love are there for you every step of the way, including the many years following your child’s birth. We are always here for you.",
        "What will my baby think of me?",
        "Adoption is the most difficult decision you can make. It is one of the most loving decisions you can make for your baby. Although it may be difficult right now, choosing adoption means that you love your baby so much that you put his or her needs above your own. Adoption allows you to give your child a happy, healthy, and stable life – one you may not be able to provide at this time. You are not giving up your baby for adoption. You are making a loving, selfless plan for his or her future. This is important to remember as you begin your adoption journey.",
