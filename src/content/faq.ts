    question: "What is a birth mother?",
    answer:

    question: "What is an adoption?",

  {
    question: "Can I choose the adoptive parents for my baby?",
    answer:
      "You can select the adoptive family and meet them to see if they’re a good fit. Some birth mothers feel more comfortable with an open adoption so that they can remain in contact with their child through letters and pictures. In this case, the birth mother and adoptive family can agree on how often they’ll communicate. Other birth mothers prefer a closed adoption, where they have no contact with the adoptive family.",
  },

    question: "Is adoption confidential?",

    question: "Will I get support after adoption?",

  },
  {
    question:
      "If I choose adoption, do I have to do it through a full-service agency?",
